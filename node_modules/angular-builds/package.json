As there are no official npm modules for Angular, I wanted a convenient way to manage Angular used for testing (with Karma) in my repos without committing the whole thing. Since my repo was already friendly to ```npm install``` after a clean clone, a Git repo seemed like an easy way to do it.\n\nTo install this version of Angular via npm, execute:\n\n    npm install https://github.com/DanTup/angular-builds/tarball/1.2.14 --save-dev\r\n",
